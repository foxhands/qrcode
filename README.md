# QR Code Generator

![banner](qr.png)

A free and opensource tool to generate Qr Codes
This script will help you create a QR Code of the text of your choice and print it in your terminal. It will also create a high quality image in your /home/<username> directory to help you store the image for later use.

The idea behind a QR code is to create an image that can be scanned by any modern day Smartphone (with a QR code reader application) and translated into something more meaningful. 

QR codes are often used to contain web address information and links.

Quite simply, a QR code is an encoded piece of data. The data in a QR code can be alphanumeric, numeric etc.
